 POLITICS_SERGIY_KRYVONIS_DESC:0 "Born on July 26 1970 in Kremenchuk, Poltava oblast, Serhiy Hryhorovych Kryvonis had a long but successful military career. He served as a lieutenant in the 10th Separate Brigade, was a lecturer at the Hetman Sahaidachny Army Academy, held the position of Commander of the Airborne Forces of Ukraine and proved himself to be a competent and proactive commander during the defence of Kramators'k Airport. A few months before the presidential election, Serhiy Kryvonis was appointed Commander-in-Chief of the Special Operations Forces (Syl Specialnykh Operacij (SSO)) of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. He proved himself once again after repelling a massive offensive by pro-Russian separatists with the help of the army deployed in Donbas. However, he was unable to support the government in Kyjiv, which largely contributed to Zelenskyy's loss of power in most of Ukraine. Now Kryvonis finds himself in a difficult position: communication with the government is currently completely cut off, so the army in Donbas is de-facto cut off from the capital. Moreover, a small move in the wrong direction could lead to a full-scale offensive from the other side of the contact line. Whatever the case, the Armed Forces of Ukraine, led by their commander-in-chief, will repel the advancing eastern hordes by any means necessary."
 POLITICS_PENIS_DUSHILIN_DESC:0 "Denis Vladimirovich Pushilin was born on 9 May 1981 in Makiivka (Makijivka), Donetsk Oblast, and his life path was quite bizarre. From a soldier in the National Guard of Ukraine, to a promoter of well-known financial schemes created by the notorious Sergei Mavrodi, he became the deputy minister of an entire state. After the death of the former president of the Donetsk People's Republic, Alexander Zakharchenko, Denis Pushilin became the new leader of the republic. With the support of the FSB, he managed to effectively establish a dictatorship by completely reshuffling the positions in the DPR's executive branch. During the initial instability in Ukraine, his forces managed to inflict significant losses on the Ukrainian army, without making any progress on the frontline. Nevertheless, his position is quite secure. He is largely a figurehead, while the real power in the country belongs to Russian oligarchs, the army and Russian special services and intelligence. As long as they are satisfied with his political position and his ability to run the country, Denis Pushilin's power will be secure in the coming years."
 POLITICS_LEONID_PASECHNIK_DESC:0 "Leonid Ivanovich Pasichnyk was born on 15 March 1970. In his younger years, after graduating from the Donetsk Military School, he worked in the Ukrainian special services and was quite successful in this field. However, having some problems and troubles with the "established" corrupt system of the Security Service and Ukraine as a whole, he resigned on the eve of the massive unrest in Ukraine in 2014. In the same year, he was appointed Minister of State Security of the newly formed Luhansk People's Republic. After the de-escalation of the conflict in Donbas, a new conflict erupted between Leonid Pasichnyk and Igor Plotnytsky, the then president of the republic. In the end, a coup d'état took place, carried out by the armed forces with the support of the DPR. Leonid Pasichnyk became the head of the republic's interim government and was later elected president with Moscow's tacit consent. During 2019, the LPR military, together with the DPR, attacked the positions of Ukrainian troops on the Luhansk front, but with no real success."
